# carp
carp is the Linux library that compile and run your program. Currently it supports only three languages C, C++ and JAVA. but I will give support for more languages later.

Without this library:
  If you want to execute a C++ program then you need to compile it by
    g++ filename.cpp
  then you need to run output file by
    ./a.out
With this library:
  C program:
    carp filename.c
  C++ program:
    carp filename.cpp
  JAVA program:
    carp filename.java
    
So, this library is much time saver.
  
NOTE: This library work on gcc and java. so, You must installed gcc and java. Backend of this library is gcc and java
